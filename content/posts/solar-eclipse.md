## Did you see the eclipse today?

I took a break from blog-building to do just that! Thankfully others had brought enough of those precious glasses to share. (My own pair, which I had been expecting in the mail, came in just an hour after I went back inside!) The crescent sun was amazing. Here in NYC it was only about 71% covered, but it was still so cool to see little fingernail shapes in the shadows of leaves and branches. I took a few photos but decided it was best just to watch it happen live. The best picture I got was a small projection through a MetroCard and someone's prescription glasses:

## Back to work

When I came inside, I saw a strange warning label I'd never noticed before. It was worded almost like one of these interior design maxims I found with a quick Google search:

* Chairs should be no more than 8 feet apart to facilitate conversation.
* Coffee tables should be located 14 to 18 inches from a sofa to provide sufficient legroom.

Or this caution from UC Berkeley's Chemical Storage Guide:

* Segregate acids from chemicals that could generate toxic gases upon contact (e.g., sodium cyanide and iron sulfide).

Humans are very interested in adjusting distances between things. Which is why this warning on a coffee maker sounded almost natural to me, until I thought about it a bit more:

I remembered a TED talk by Gever Tully called "5 dangerous things you should let your kids do." I've always thought some safety measures are a bit absurd, and that kids know best how to protect themselves from obvious danger, or at least they would, if given the chance to learn. Thinking of kids as (somewhat) sensible agents of their own comfort, instead of ottomans or sulfides in storage, might well be a good idea. As a kid, I might have been burnt the first time, but not the second! Check out that TED talk [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/gever_tulley_on_5_dangerous_things_for_kids#t-1161).
