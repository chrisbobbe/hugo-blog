## A new look!

The most attentive among you might have noticed that I've done a styling overhaul for my blog! I can't really take credit for it, though. It was just a more advanced version of dschau's blogging template over at [gatsbyjs.org](https://github.com/dschau/gatsby-blog-starter-kit). I chose to make this change mostly for the tagging functionality it offers; I'm really excited to see how it works, considering that I used to think it would be close to impossible for a static site generator to handle such a feature. I mean, a static site isn't supposed to let you ping back and forth with a database, is it?? It turns out that it works with GraphQL, in a way that I don't fully understand yet. It's _like_ having a database you can make queries to. But I'll need to get more familiar with this as I look at even more exciting ways to filter and display blog posts.

## Networking!

Yesterday I attended a super interesting talk about networking -- not the kind you do for your career, but what goes on in your computer when you hook it up to the interwebs. It was hosted by my brilliant fellow Recurser Christian Ternus, and it went from the ground up! I wrote down a nice 7-point list in my notebook along with squiggly diagrams that probably won't render well in Markdown :(

1.  Physical
2.  Data Link
3.  Network
4.  Transport
5.  Session
6.  Presentation
7.  Application

I learned a lot, and I have more questions for him so I hope to track him down soon!

## Game of Life!

Just started a plain JavaScript implementation of Conway's Game of Life with fellow Recurser Michael Noronha. It isn't much just yet, but it does respond to mouse events!! Here's a working implementation so you can play to your heart's content (at least until we roll out a superior version, of course...): http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/
