## Welcome to my first blog post!
I'm hoping to make more soon. Are you excited to see many daredevil coding stunts coming from an English major? I hope so. I think it's important for posterity to know that I've discovered many useful styling features of Markdown. These features

| modal verb     | bare infinitive | pronoun | bare infinitive | noun    | adverb        | conjunction |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| would          | help            | me      | format          | things  | _elegantly_   | and         |
| might          | make            | you     | appreciate      | styles  | attentively   | or          |
| ...            | **launch**      | me      | pursue          | job     | unfailingly   | but         |
| shouldn't      | let             | us      | over-excite     | selves  | unnecessarily | (though).     |

I'm reminded of a story by George Saunders in which the main character makes a valorous decision:

> have resolved to embark on grand project of writing every day in this new black book just got at OfficeMax. Exciting to think how in one year, at rate of one page/day, will have written three hundred and sixty-five pages, and what a picture of life and times then available for kids & grandkids...

That story gets disturbing really fast. Imagine doing something like that... Can I continue this blogging journey without blood on my hands? I hope so. So far, Markdown is _extremely_ easy to work with. And look at that, I've just italicized an adverb! You must have seen the quote block too. Very smooth. This is going well.

## My goals
I came to the Recurse Center to become a dramatically better programmer, as they say, and I'm working hard. I think starting a blog will help add to the drama. What if I miss a post? And seven weeks have already gone by, and this is the first peep you've seen from me! These are the kinds of pressures that keep me going. Nothing too dramatic -- this isn't a George Saunders world (!) -- but having to show others my work will be effective discipline. In the meantime -- and see, I'm about to format an Internet link here -- go read that story I just mentioned. You know you want to. It's really good. [Here it is.](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/10/15/the-semplica-girl-diaries) Whew! First one done.
